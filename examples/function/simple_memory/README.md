## Objective

Implements a simple short term, long-term, and archive memory for the LLM to use.

## About


Giving the LLM a memory allows it to store and retrieve information across conversations.
I've found it great for a number of use cases including
 - allowing it to remember how to perform certain operations that differ from its training
 - remembering facts about people or things, thereby reducing infomation you encode in your prompt
 - can be used to set (remember) reminders that it should recall during conversation later
 - reduce amount of tokens consumed; allowing it to use cheaper models while maintaining better results

## Approach

This is a functional proof of concept split into a set of function calls that invoke a sensor via event triggers.

The memories are implemented as dictionaries hidden inside a HA sensor. The LLM is told that these are dictornaries, and should encode a concise description in the key, followed by more information in the value.

The memories are separated into short-term, long-term and archive.  You don't need to have all three, but so far I've found it helps me and the LLM manage memories.  That is,

 - short term memory is intended for items we shouldn't need to remember for long.
 - long term memory is intended for items we need to remember, such as reoccuring memories, but are unlikely to needed forever.
 - the archive memory is intended for things you want to keep forever.

The intent with these three is that the keys, and perhaps values, for both short-term and long-term should fit in token space.  These could be passed in with the prompt or you could let the LLM probe them on its own.

The archive memory can only be referenced by key.  In this case the LLM will query for a list of keys, and can then retrieve a memory based upon a  key it likes.

### Notes

 - If you want to keep it simple to start you could drop the archive or even long-term memory.
 - It might be worth playing around with the function description fields below to help instruct the LLM on how to use (this may reduce prompt text).
 - This is intended as a proof of concept. I'll probably implement it as a python module in the future as this will be cleaner and can use a proper db backend.

# Installation

There are three parts to install
 - prompt text
 - function specs
 - Home Assistant template sensor

## Prompt

I add this to my prompt.  Although I haven't tried, it could be made much more concise or perhaps avoided altogether by encoding information in the sensor or function call descriptions.

```text
sensor.memory is our memory storage bank. Use the memory sensor to store and retrieve short_term, long_term or archived memories.
The short_term and long_term memories can be read via the sensor's attributes.
Consult the memory sensor before answering queries as it may contain relevant information.
Please check short_term memories now for anything we should act upon. You can let me know we should discuss those as part of the response to my query.
Please also store in the appropriate memory any information you may need to recall later and include details. You can use it to remember summaries of conversations or any important events, reminders, and details.
If any short_term memories such as reminders that have past that we have discussed, feel free to clean them up.
Keep the short_term and long_term with a limited set of entries that are good to manage the day-to-day and need instant recall. For other memories, use the chronicle.

check memory first before answering.
```

Memories from both of these are immediately available via the attributes. You can optionally set due_timestamp in isoformat. Short-term memory is for tasks and reminders that are relevant for the day or coming weekâ€”things you need to act on soon. Long-term memory holds information that's important over the next few months or has no specific due date but you'll need to recall eventually. The chronicle memory archives significant events, detailed information, and milestones you want to preserve for years or reflect on in the future, without cluttering your active reminders and tasks. Use the chronicle memory for important events, milestones, or detailed information that you want to preserve over the long term and may not need to recall immediately but is significant for historical reference or future reflection. To check for useful topics or memories in the chronical memory you must first consult the chronicle_available_keys attribute to know what key or keys to retrieve.
